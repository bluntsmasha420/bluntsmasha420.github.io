        <p>Hello World. This is my first blog post on my khan academy computer programming blog. Thanks for checking me out. I really find this site is great for learning on and can't wait to learn all of the computer programming area here. Thanks for this great opportunity Sal!</p>
        
        <h2 id="cssText" class="title">Second Post - CSS Text Properties</h2>
        <h6>Tuesday July 24th, 2018</h6>
        
        <p>Today I learned the second half of the CSS text properties section here in Khan Academy. I hope to progress a bit further today but am getting pretty tired from being up all night with poor Fox whose getting his molars in. I also have to give Liquid Mike a hand with Endomaps troubleshooting tongiht so may have to call it quits here. </p>

        <p>I plan to make the extra effort today to complete this project and move onto the Web Development Tools part of Intro to HTML/CSS: Making Webpages. Feels good to be making this progress and learning some things that will help me with my endomaps.world project.</p>
