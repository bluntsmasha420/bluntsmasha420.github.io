        <h6>Tuesday July 24th, 2018</h6>
        
        <p>Hello World. This is my first blog post on my khan academy computer programming blog. Thanks for checking me out. I really find this site is great for learning on and can't wait to learn all of the computer programming area here. Thanks for this great opportunity Sal!</p>
        
        
        <h2 id="cssText" class="title">Second Post - CSS Text Properties</h2>
        <h6>Tuesday July 24th, 2018</h6>
        
        <p>Today I learned the second half of the CSS text properties section here in Khan Academy. I hope to progress a bit further today but am getting pretty tired from being up all night with poor Fox whose getting his molars in. I also have to give Liquid Mike a hand with Endomaps troubleshooting tongiht so may have to call it quits here. </p>
        
        
        <h2 id="webDevTools" class="title">Third Post - On to Web Development Tools</h2>
        <h6>Tuesday July 25th, 2018</h6>
        
        <p>I plan to make the extra effort today to complete this project and move onto the Web Development Tools part of Intro to HTML/CSS: Making Webpages. Feels good to be making this progress and learning some things that will help me with my endomaps.world project.</p>
        
        
        <h2 id="webDevToolsComp" class="title">Fourth Post - Web Development Tools Complete</h2>
        <h6>Tuesday July 25th, 2018</h6>
        
        <p>I made it through the Web development tools and got some great advice along the way. I will have to get my github account all ready so i can utilize the online live editor similar to khan academy here at <a href="http://ide.c9.io/">Cloud 9</a>. For offline use i have Visual Studio Code and Sublime Text downloaded on my computer for that purpose. They will still require set up for the colors and syntax. Lastly I now have a place to host some of my webpage files so i can continue to learn my own projects better with my <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> website. </p>
        
        
        <h2 id="cssLayout" class="title">Fifth Post - CSS Layout Complete</h2>
        <h6>Sunday July 29th, 2018</h6>
        
        <p>This was a big section. It covered:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>How you should group similar blocks for positioning and attribute manipulation. Divs and spans</li>
            <li>How to set the width, height and what happens when the text overflows the parameters like the direction it goes and if it gets a scroll bar</li>
            <li>The box model and how it contains, margin, border, padding and content.</li>
            <li>Positioning with absolute, fixed and relative</li>
            <li>Floating objects with z-indexing</li>
        </ol>
        
        
        <h2 id="morecss" class="title">Sixth Post - More CSS Selectors Complete</h2>
        <h6>Tuesday July 29th, 2018</h6>
        
        <p>Another big section complete today. I am on a roll. Easier to focus with the little guy visiting the parents.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In this section I learned how to add more than one class to a tag simply by adding a space and the next class.</li>
            <li>Next I learned how to be combine element and class selectors like 'p.info' would be specific to paragraphs with the class info.</li>
            <li>I learned about getting really specific with elements inside of classes like 'ul.content li strong' would effect the unordered list with the content class and then further only the elements that are in the list and have a strong tag applied.</li>
            <li>If I need to group two classes to have the same properties all I need to do it add a comma between them like h1, h2 {}. The key to that one is the comma.</li>
            <li>Pseudo-classes are used to select info that is not part of the webpage structure or can't be expressed using other selectors example: 'a:hover, a:active, a:focus { }' this code will activate when a link or "a" element is acted upon with the conditions hover(mouseOver), active(clicked) or focus(tab selected)</li>
            <li>Lastly I learned specificity. Which is how your browser selects which attribute to apply if there are conflicting information. It will go from least important element, class then id. The more specific you are like p.class then it will chose the one that has more specificity.</li>
        </ul>
